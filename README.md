# vscode_settings
Personal preferences for VSCode.

Currently using [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) with [vscode-sync-settings](https://github.com/zokugun/vscode-sync-settings)
because it supports [monkey-patch](https://github.com/iocave/monkey-patch)
and [customize-ui](https://github.com/iocave/customize-ui).
